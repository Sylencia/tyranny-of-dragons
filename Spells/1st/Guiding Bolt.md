A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within **Range**. Make a ****Range**d spell attack** against the target. On a hit, the target takes **4d6 radiant damage**, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
